# Popity
This is a game I developed using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and written in C#. The CircleController.cs file here represents the controller functionality of the circles that you interact with in game play. 

The game can be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beesneezestudios.popity&hl=en)
